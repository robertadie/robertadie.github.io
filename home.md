title: Robert Adie
layout: page
subtitle: New Pages are Cool
#order: 0 #(orders links in the nav menu, e.g. 1)
icon: fa-github #(optional; see Font Awesome for icon codes. Example: fa-github)
icon-style: #(optional; "solid" is default, "regular" for outline style icons, or "brands" for logos)
hide: true #(optional; if true, a link won't appear in the nav menu. All this does is remove the nav link; your page will still be served to anyone who has the URL.)
#For advanced SEO, this theme also lets you add permalink (see Jekyll Docs), robots (string, e.g. "noindex, nofollow"), and canonical (boolean; true is default) to any page or post.
